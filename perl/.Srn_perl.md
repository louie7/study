## Perldoc
### options
<blockquote>
-q perlfaq-search-regexp <br>
The -q option takes a regular expression as an argument.  It will search the question headings in perlfaq[1-9] and print the entries matching the regular expression.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
-v perlvar
    The -v option followed by the name of a Perl predefined variable will extract the documentation of this variable from perlvar.
```perl
    perldoc -v '$"'
    perldoc -v '$#'
```
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
PageName|ModuleName|ProgramName|URL <br>
The item you want to look up.  Nested modules (such as "File::Basename") are specified either as "File::Basename" or "File/Basename".
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
-m module
    Display the entire module: both code and unformatted pod documentation.  This may be useful if the docs don't explain a function in the detail you need, and you'd like to inspect the code directly; perldoc will find the file for you and simply hand it off for display.

## [perldata](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/perl/pod/perldata.pod)

> Perl has three built-in data types: scalars, arrays of scalars, and associative arrays of scalars, known as "hashes".
 - A scalar is a single string (of any size, limited only by the available memory), number, or a reference to something (which will be discussed in perlref).
 - Normal arrays are ordered lists of scalars indexed by number, starting with 0.
 - Hashes are unordered collections of scalar values indexed by their associated string key.

> Values are usually referred to by name, or through a named reference. The first character of the name tells you to what sort of data structure it refers. The rest of the name tells you the particular value to which it refers.

scalar values are named with '$', even when referring to a scalar that is part of an array or a has. (like the English word "the") indicates a single value is expected.

```perl
$days
$days[28]
$days{'Feb'}
$#days            #the last index of array @days
```

Entire arrays are denoted by '@' (like the "these" or "those" does in English)
```perl
@days[3,4,5] # same as($days[3],$days[4],$days[5])
@days{'a','c'}   # same as ($days{'a'},$days{'c'})
```

Entire hashes are denoted by '%'

### Context
The interpretation of operations and values in Perl sometimes depends on the requirements of the context around the operation or value. There are two major contexts: list and scalar.

### scalar values
All data in Perl is a scalar, an array of scalars, or a hash of scalars.
A scalar may contain one single value in any of three different flavors: a number, a string, or a reference.
Although a scalar may not directly hold multiple values, it may contain a reference to an array or hash which in turn contains multiple values.

> A scalar value is interpreted as FALSE in the Boolean sense if it is undefined, the null string or the number 0 (or its string equivalent, "0"), and TRUE if it is anything else.

truncate an array to nothing:
```perl
@wahtever = ();
$#whatever = -1;
```

If you evaluate an array in scalar context, it returns the length of the array.
```perl
$element_count = scalar(@wahtever);
```

### List value constructors
LISTs do automatic interpolation of sublists. That is, when a LIST is evaluated, each element of the list is evaluated in list context, and the resulting list value is interpolated into LIST just as if each individual element were a member of LIST.
```perl
(@foo, &SomeSub, %glarch)
```

A list value may also be subscripted like a normal array.
```perl
$time = (stat($file))[8];
```

An exception to this is that you may assign to undef in a list. This is useful for throwing away some of the return values of a function:
```perl
($dev, $ino, undef, undef, $uid, $gid) = stat($file);
```

The final element of a list assignment may be an array or a hash:
```perl
($a, $b, @rest) = split;
my ($a, $b, %rest) = @_;
```

It is often more readable to use the => operator between key/value pairs.
```perl
%map = (
    red => 0x00f,
    blue => 0x0f0,
    );
```

initializing hash referencese:
```perl
    $rec = {
        date => '10/31',
        cat => 'moew',
    };
```

### slice
```perl
($who, $home)  = @ENV{"USER", "HOME"};      # hash slice
@them          = @folks[0 .. 3];            # array slice
```

#### Key/Value Hash Slices
Starting from Perl 5.20 support
```perl
%h = (blonk => 2, foo => 3, squink => 5, bar => 8);
%subset = %h{'foo', 'bar'}; # key/value hash slice
## %subset is now (foo => 3, bar => 8)
```

### Typeglobs and Filehandles
Perl uses an internal type called a typeglob to hold an entire symbol table entry. 
The type prefix of a typeglob is a `*` , because it represents all types.
```perl
local *Here::blue = \$There::green;
```
> temporarily makes `$Here::blue` an alias for `$There::green`, but doesn't make @Here::blue an alias for @There::green, or %Here::blue an alias for %There::green, etc.
